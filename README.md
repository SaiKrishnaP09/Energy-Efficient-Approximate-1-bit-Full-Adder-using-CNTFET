# Energy-Efficient-Approximate-1-bit-Full-Adder-using-CNTFET
The objectives of energy efficient 1-bit approximate full adders using CNTFET are
   To design the approximate full adder 
   To reduce the number of transistors
   To reduce the power consumption and delay
   To implement RCA and 2*4 multiplier using the proposed approximate adder
