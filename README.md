# Energy-Efficient-Approximate-1-bit-Full-Adder-using-CNTFET
The objectives of energy efficient 1-bit approximate full adders using CNTFET are
 1. To design the approximate full adder 
 2. To reduce the number of transistors
 3. To reduce the power consumption and delay
 4. To implement RCA and 2*4 multiplier using the proposed approximate adder
